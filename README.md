GED-LAB03-ASN01

The assignment is comprised of 5 tasks, and two bonuses (singleton and factory).
I completed all tasks and the singleton portion, but I did not do the factory bonus.

On another note, the video submitted with this assignment had a poor framerate when recording the gameplay.
This is due to the machine I'm running the program on not having very high specs, as well as running a Unity project while recording said project being computationally intensive.
Due to this repository being public, a link to the video will not be included in this README.

There is one branch with just the base assignment and no bonuses (titled "standard"), one branch with the bonus included, and the main repo branch.
The main repo branch has been updated with the bonus since implementing the bonus content was successful.
